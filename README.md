![Phoenix Logo](.readme/phoenix_text.png)

Phoenix is a Bitcoin wallet developed by [ACINQ](https://acinq.co), that allows you to send and receive bitcoins securely. It is non custodial and provides a simple and clean UX. Thanks to native Lightning support, payments are faster and cheaper.

This is a [Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/home.html) application and can run on iOS and Android. It uses the [lightning-kmp](https://github.com/ACINQ/lightning-kmp) implementation to connect and interact with the Lightning Network. You can read more about the technological choices for this application in our [blog post](https://medium.com/@ACINQ/when-ios-cdf798d5f8ef).

# Run Phoenix

---

:construction: Phoenix runs on Mainnet but is still experimental. Do not put too much money in the wallet.

---

### Phoenix on iOS

Phoenix is available on TestFlight, and requires iOS 14+. You can apply for the beta by sending an email to phoenix@acinq.co.

### Phoenix on Android

The KMM Android application is not ready yet. In the meantime, you can install the existing, battle-tested Phoenix Wallet application from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ACINQ/phoenix) or from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.acinq.phoenix.mainnet). Eventually, the KMM Android app will replace the existing Android application.

# Build and test Phoenix
